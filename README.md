# **Penguin Escape**

## Project Description

Penguin Escape is a grid-based puzzle game where you control a penguin to overcome various challenging obstacles. In each level, collect all of the stars to move on. But beware! Pebbles the Penguin will leave a lava path of destruction behind him, so you will not be able to step on a previous square again. There is also a ghost chasing you, which will deal damage if touched. **Can you overcome 15+ unique levels and help Pebbles get home?**

## Explanation of Objects

1. Star - Collect all of these to beat the level!
2. Wall - These will block you from moving to that tile.
3. Lava - Similar to a wall, but can be cleared using a button.
4. Portal - When you go through one of them, you will be teleported to the other.
5. Button - When pressed, all of the lava will disappear. Green buttons are single use only, but red ones can be reused!
6. Krill (Shrimp) - Touching the shrimp will regenerate all of your health.
7. Enemy (Ghost) - The enemy will chase you around the level, dealing damage if touched. If you lose all of your hearts, the game restarts!
8. Freeze (Snowflake) - Touching this will freeze Pebbles the Penguin for 3 seconds.
